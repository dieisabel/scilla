## 1. Introduction

This document contains plan for developing Scilla project. Text is written in English,
Markdown format.

## 2. Phases

Project development divided into phases:
1. Initialization
1. System Design and Development
1. Testing and Validation

Each phase described in it's own chapter below.

### 2.1 Phase 1: Initialization

**Objective:** lay groundwork for the project.

**Activities:**
1. Set up project repository
1. Form technical task and requirements

**Deliverables:**
1. Repository for project documentation
1. Approved technical task and requirements

### 2.2 Phase 2: System Design and Development

**Objective:** Design a system concept: architecture, requirements specifications,
operation algorithms and testing documentation. Develop complete system.

**Activities:**
1. Design the high-level system architecture
1. Define requirements specifications
1. Design operation algorithms
1. Design software and hardware architectures
1. Design testing documentation
1. Produce hardware
1. Develop software

**Deliverables:**
1. High-level system architecture document
1. Requirements specifications document
1. Operation algorithms documents
1. Software architecture document
1. Hardware architecture document
1. Testing document
1. Fully functional device

### 2.3 Phase 3: Testing and Validation

**Objective:** Ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

**Activities:**
1. Perform extensive testing of all features
1. Address issues found during testing

**Deliverables:**
1. Test report
